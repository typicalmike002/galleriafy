# Galleriafy
## WordPress Plugin ##
Adds a custom WordPress post type named 'gallery' that allows a WordPress admin to organize groups of images into named galleries.  It uses WordPress's built in "add media" -> "create gallery" feature which admins normally use to add images from their media library to a page or post.  This plugin was built for developers who want to code their own front end and keep their gallery code seperate from the main theme files.
